# Task-1-Prediction-using-Supervised-Learning
Here I have created the prediction using simple linear regression where I have predicted the marks of a student based on the number of study hours of that student.

Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

●  I did it using Python. 

● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
